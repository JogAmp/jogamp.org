abstract     = {JogAmp provides the high performance cross platform libraries 
                JOGL, JOCL and JOAL to the OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL APIs for the Java Virtual Machine.
                GlueGen, a toolkit part of JogAmp, provides generation of Java and Java Native Interface (JNI) 
                code as required to call C functions of native libraries.
                JOGL gives full access to all OpenGL desktop and mobile APIs, while integrating
                existing native windowing toolkits and providing its own, NEWT.
                Further it adds access to multimedia streams and provides hardware accelerated
                rendering of curves and text.
                JOCL gives full access to the OpenCL processing APIs.
                JOAL gives full access to the OpenAL audio APIs.
                JogAmp is free-software and licensed under the permissible New BSD 2-clause license or compatibles.
                JogAmp is authored by multiple individuals, see the source code repository commit messages for details.
